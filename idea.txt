Create a table structure such that user can configure his own css. 
The table will have the following functionalities :
Sorting.
Search filter.
pagination and go to page option.
Create hanlders such that entire row data can be accessed by the row selection (can be single or multiple).
I am not clear about this - On a certain operation if data gets updated we need to see -
- if we can just refresh the effected part or we need to refresh the table.

We can develop these features in our first phase of development.
